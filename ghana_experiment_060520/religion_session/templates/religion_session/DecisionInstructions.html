Decisions on how to divide {{ Constants.endowment }} GHS
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}


In this experiment, you will answer {{n_questions}} questions. In each
question, we ask you to choose how to divide {{ Constants.endowment }} GHS betwen two
options. 
<br>
<br>

You will be choosing between pairs of the
following options: keeping the money for yourself, a donation to the
church, a donation to the national thanksgiving offering, or a
donation to the street children's fund. Each of these is described in more detail below.
<br>
<br>

After you have answered all {{n_questions}} questions, one of them
will be randomly chosen, and your {{ Constants.endowment }} cedis will be spent according to the choice you made.
