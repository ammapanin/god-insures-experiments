In the public goods game, each participant may put money in a common pot. The value of this pot is multiplied by 1.5 and then this total value is shared evenly amongst all participants. If everyone puts in money, all participants may be able to increase their earnings by 1.5. However, if only a few participants put money into the common pot, they will lose out at the expense of other participants. This game tests trust within a group.
